# Getting Started

Now when it comes to programming of any kind I would suggest to use a linux operating system as it is easier to program in Linux for a few reasons: the command line interface is a little more flexible than windows, there are many text editors in linux you can use to code with, and there are built in development tools just to name a few. The next few headers are dedicated to using the command line in linux to set up git and to connect a local repository to github. Now for those who want to use linux and do not want to use a virtual machine to install linux then there is Windows subsystem for Linux which will create a version of linux as a subsystem on Windows. Meaning you can use linux within the Windows OS. I would suggest using this for most people. 

But for those who do not really want to use Linux, although I do not advise it, and want to just use Windows you can use Github Desktop. Github Desktop is the desktop application to interact with Git and Github in a GUI. Although Git already has a GUI with it, however it does not have an easy way to connect to Github like Github Desktop does. But there is a header dedicated to using Github Desktop you can go to below.
